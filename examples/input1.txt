Hi, we’re planning a family vacation and need some help putting it together. 
There will be four of us—two adults and two kids, aged 8 and 12. We’re looking for something relaxing but fun 
for the kids, too. Ideally, we’d want a mix of outdoor activities like hiking or water sports and some downtime to 
just enjoy the scenery or maybe a nice pool. We’re thinking of traveling sometime in the summer, probably for a week. 
If there’s a place with family-friendly attractions or something educational for the kids, that would be great
