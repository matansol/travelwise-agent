My partner and I are looking to plan a romantic getaway for just the two of us. We’d like something quiet and intimate, 
maybe with beautiful views, good food, and opportunities to unwind—like spa treatments. We’d also love to 
explore a bit, maybe take a cooking class or do some wine tasting, but nothing too strenuous. We’re thinking of taking this trip 
in the spring for about 4 or 5 days.
