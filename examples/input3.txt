Hi there! My friends and I are planning an adventure trip, and we’d love your help organizing it. There are five of us, and 
we’re all pretty active—we’re into things like kayaking, rock climbing, and maybe even some zip-lining. We’re looking for 
something that gets us outdoors and keeps us moving but also gives us a chance to explore local culture and try some great food.
We’re thinking about a 10-day trip in the fall
